It provides instructions on how to migrate custom subdomains from Deta Cloud to Deta Space. **If you're looking to simply learn about Deta Space, it's recommended to read the [new documentation](https://deta.space/docs).**

## Instructions
### Summary
Go to your app's settings page (the app ypu want to migrate a subdomain to) and switch to the "Domains" and click on "Migrate Legacy Subdomain". Then choose the domain you want to migrate and follow the instructions. You can repeat this step to migrate multiple domains.

You will be able to migrate your custom subdomains until June 1, 2023.

### Detailed Instructions
