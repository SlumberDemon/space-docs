On Space, you can back-up and eject the data stored in every app you install, or any [Collection](/docs/en/use/your-data/collections) you create.

Click the "Export" button to create an export of your app's data. This will trigger an export process which will run. 

The status of the export is indicated by the colored dot on the left side. You can click the "Refresh" button to see the latest status. 
A successful status (green) indicates that your export was completed successfully and can be downloaded.

#### Downloading an Export

You can download an any completed data export by clicking the download button.
This will download a `.zip` archive to your local machine, containing all of the data associated with the export.

The format of the data in an export will include a `bases`  folder with a `json` file for every Deta Base, 
and a `drives` folder with a sub-folder for each of your Collection's Deta Drives.

```json
/ bases
		my_first_base.json
		my_second_base.json

/ drives
		/ my_first_drive
        my_first_image.png
        ...

		/ my_second_drive
        my_twentieth_image.png
```

##### Deleting an Export

To delete an Export, click the trash icon next to the export. This action is irreversible.
